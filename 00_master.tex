%% For managing citations, it is recommended to use bibliography
%% files in BibTeX format.
%%
%% You can then either use BibTeX with the ACM-Reference-Format style,
%% or BibLaTeX with the acmnumeric or acmauthoryear sytles, that include
%% support for advanced citation of software artefact from the
%% biblatex-software package, also separately available on CTAN.
%%
%% Look at the sample-*-biblatex.tex files for templates showcasing
%% the biblatex styles.

%%
%% The majority of ACM publications use numbered citations and
%% references.  The command \citestyle{authoryear} switches to the
%% "author year" style.
%%
%% If you are preparing content for an event
%% sponsored by ACM SIGGRAPH, you must use the "author year" style of
%% citations and references.
%% Uncommenting

%%
%% The "author" command and its associated commands are used to define
%% the authors and their affiliations.
%% Of note is the shared affiliation of the first two authors, and the
%% "authornote" and "authornotemark" commands
%% used to denote shared contribution to the research.

%% The abstract is a short summary of the work to be presented in the article.
\begin{abstract}
  Here goes your abstract in max 250 - 300 words. As only one paragraph, summarizing the interest of your work. Remember the main points : 
\begin{itemize}
    \item 1st paragraph: explain why the issue is really important Here is the answer to the question "what is the context and why does this matter", to the society or a group of people.
    \item 2nd paragraph : explain your specific question that although it matters a lot, we donâ€™t have much coverage for it. Although it matters to the community for the reasons above, this is the current state of the situation : we found something that is missing or is not adapted and there's not much related work about this
    \item 3rd paragraph : explain on what your research design focuses, what data it relies on, and what methods it uses, as well as what you have learned about the question and what are the implications. We saw why it matters, we know the situation and identified what is missing, so here is our solution to fill in this gap in a concise phrase and one that gives the main points of the solution.
\end{itemize}
