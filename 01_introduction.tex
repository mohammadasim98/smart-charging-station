\section{Introduction}
Here goes the ameliorated version of the introduction you wrote for the previous milestone, based on the feedback and the evolution of your thoughts. This section can include some references of the domain if needed, however they remain general.
Remember the introduction follows the same plan as the abstract and elaborates each of the summarized parts. 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Motivation - Setting the stage and suggesting why the coming problem should be relevant
    \item Problem - Phrase the problem precisely that you are about to tackle. These problems/challenges need to have a clear and strong mapping to your contribution. Do NOT name any problems that your project/contribution does not solve.
    \item Solution - Now I understand the problem and care for it because of the motivation. Now tell me how you think you solved it
    \item Method - Ok interesting so now tell me a little bit about how you did that 
\end{itemize}

Remember the speech remains mostly impersonal, using pronouns as "we" or expressions like "in this work", "this concept/project presents" etc. You're supposed to be concise and factual, every phrase is supposed to give the lecturer a piece on valuable information.
